These simulations are discussed in an [accompanying blog post](http://www.clintonboys.com/uk-av-sim/).

The data for England is obtained by scraping the Wikipedia pages, before I realised I could just copy and paste it into a Google Sheet and remove the formatting, which I did for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

The runoff simulator itself is old code I wrote for my [Emma Chisit](https://github.com/clintonboys/emma-chisit-2019) model.
